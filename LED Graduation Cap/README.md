# About this Project
The project is for the class Embedded Linux for Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology taught by Dr. Yoder. This is a project that uses a 32x32 LED matrix and a Pocket Beagle to display twitter tweets and GIFs. More about this project can be found here: https://elinux.org/ECE497_Project_-_LED_Matrix_Graduation_Cap.

The code and other information can be found at my partners repo here: https://github.com/ObbyKing/ece434_linux/tree/master/finalProject.
