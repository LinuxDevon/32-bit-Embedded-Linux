6. GAME

The game is a basic GUI based etch-a-sketch game. You use the keys listed below
to move the cursor around and print an X where the cursor has been. This app
uses ncurses for the graphics. The code makes the window based on the size the
user inputs. There shouldn't be any extra installs. 

# RUN
Just do `./main.py`

# INSTRUCTIONS
* w - up
* d - down
* a - left
* b - right
* e - exit
* c - clear

# BUGS:
* If you resize the window smaller than what originally created the windows gets
screwed up. You just have to exit and restart the game.
