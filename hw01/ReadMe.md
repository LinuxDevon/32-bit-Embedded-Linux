6. GAME

The game is a basic GUI based etch-a-sketch game. You use the keys listed below
to move the cursor around and print an X where the cursor has been. This app
uses ncurses for the graphics. The code makes the window based on the size the
user inputs. There shouldn't be any extra installs. 

# RUN
Just do `./main.py`

# INSTRUCTIONS
* w - up
* s - down
* a - left
* d - right
* e - exit
* c - clear

# BUGS:
* If you resize the window smaller than what originally created the windows gets
screwed up. You just have to exit and restart the game.


Looks good, though you had two errors in your instructions.

Score:  9/10
