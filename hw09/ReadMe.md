This homework deals with the PRU on the beaglebone. We look at how we can produce stable and fast PWM waveforms.

The table of all of the picture for each part can be seen in the HW09 excel file.

# 2.6 Blinking an LED
Results shown in table. Overall it was very stable and smooth. It wasn't very good looking and had a lot
of overshoot.

# 5.3 PWM Generator
Results shown in table. I couldn't get the 50 MHz mark when i tried this. When i maxed it out the waveform
was not very stable but when it wasn't max it looked very stable. When it was lower frequency it looked stable.

# 5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency
Results shown in table. The waveform looked good but i couldn't get it very fast. 326.8 kHz.

# 5.5 Loop Unrolling
Results shown in table. The waveform also looked good and the speed was multiple times faster 1.6 MHz.

# 5.9 Reading an Input
Results shown in table. The overall delay was about 59 ns.
