The goal for this homework was to read an i2c device and log it to google sheets.

# Milestones
Andy and I have put up a table of all the milestones we need to hit for this project and it can be found here: https://elinux.org/ECE497_Project_-_LED_Matrix_Graduation_Cap under the Work Breakdown section.

# Logging
I used the `temp.js` to do the logging for this part. 

The Logging_to_Sheets.png is showing that i have read in the temp data from the sensor.

The updating_temp.png is showing the output from the `temp.js` script when it collects every 15 seconds.

Professor Yoder's Comments

Looks logged.  You have some wild temp swings.

Score:  10/10
